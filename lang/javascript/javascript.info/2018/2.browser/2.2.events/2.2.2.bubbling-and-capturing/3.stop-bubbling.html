  // Stopping bubbling

  // A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till <html>, and then to document object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.
  // But any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.

  // event.stopImmediatePropagation()
  
  // If an element has multiple event handlers on a single event, then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.

  // In other words, event.stopPropagation() stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.

  // To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, thereâ€™s a method event.stopImmediatePropagation(). After it no other handlers execute.
