Certain events flow one into another. If we prevent the first event, there will be no second.

For instance, mousedown on an field leads to focusing in it, and the focus event. If we prevent the mousedown event, there’s no focus.

Try to click on the first below – the focus event happens. That’s normal.

But if you click the second one, there’s no focus.

<input value="Focus works" onfocus="this.value=''">
<input onmousedown="return false" onfocus="this.value=''" value="Click me">
