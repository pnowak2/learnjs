<!--To properly handle an event we’d want to know more about what’s happened. Not just a “click” or a “keypress”, but what were the pointer coordinates? Which key was pressed? And so on.
  When an event happens, the browser creates an event object, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.
  Here’s an example of getting mouse coordinates from the event object:-->

<input type="button" value="Click me" id="elem">

<script>
  elem.onclick = function (event) {
    // show event type, element and coordinates of the click
    console.log(event.type + " at " + event.currentTarget);
    console.log("Coordinates: " + event.clientX + ":" + event.clientY);
  };

  // event.type
  // Event type, here it’s "click".

  // event.currentTarget
  // Element that handled the event. That’s exactly the same as this, unless you bind this to something else, and then event.currentTarget becomes useful.

  // event.clientX / event.clientY
  // Window-relative coordinates of the cursor, for mouse events.


  // The event object is also accessible from HTML
  // If we assign a handler in HTML, we can also use the event object, like this:

  // <input type="button" onclick= "alert(event.type)" value= "Event type" >

</script>
