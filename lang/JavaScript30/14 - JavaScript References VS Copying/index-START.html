    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.



    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(0);
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    console.log(players, team2);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    console.log(team3);

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[0] = 'boo';
    console.log(team4, players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    let person = {
      name: 'piotr'
    }

    let another = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 37 });
    let another2 = {...person}

    another.name = 'andrew';

    console.log(person, another2);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
