## Process

* Choose the typeface for the body copy.
* Choose an appropriate font-size the body copy—usually 16px (100%).
* Choose an appropriate line-height for the body text—usually between 1.3–1.5 (depending on screen size).
* Choose a type scale, often based on a musical or other natural scale.
* Set up the CSS font-sizes, line-heights, and margins to create the rhythm.
* Create a set of utility classes to be used throughout your design.
