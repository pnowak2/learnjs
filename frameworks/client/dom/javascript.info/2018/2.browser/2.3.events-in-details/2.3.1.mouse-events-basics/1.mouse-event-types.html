Simple events

The most used simple events are:

mousedown/mouseup
  Mouse button is clicked/released over an element.
mouseover/mouseout
  Mouse pointer comes over/out from an element.
mousemove
  Every mouse move over an element triggers that event.

…There are several other event types too, we’ll cover them later.

Complex events

click
  Triggers after mousedown and then mouseup over the same element.
contextmenu
  Triggers after mousedown if the right mouse button was used.
dblclick
  Triggers after a double click over an element.

Complex events are made of simple ones, so in theory we could live without them. But they exist, and that’s good, because they are convenient.

For touchscreen and touchpad devices mouse events also happen, they are emulated.
