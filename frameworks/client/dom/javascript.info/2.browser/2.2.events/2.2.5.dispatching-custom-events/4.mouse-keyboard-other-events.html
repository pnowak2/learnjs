MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and others 

Here’s a short list of classes for UI Events from the UI Event specification: 

UIEvent
FocusEvent 
MouseEvent 
WheelEvent 
KeyboardEvent
… 

We should use them instead of new Event if we want to create such events.
For instance, new MouseEvent("click"). The right constructor allows to specify standard properties for that type of event.
Like clientX/clientY for a mouse event:

<script>
  let event = new MouseEvent("click", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    clientX: 100,
    clientY: 100
  });

  alert(event.clientX); // 100

</script>

Please note: the generic Event constructor does not allow that. Let’s try: let event = new Event("click", { bubbles: true,
// only bubbles and cancelable cancelable: true, // work in the Event constructor clientX: 100, clientY: 100 }); alert(event.clientX);
// undefined, the unknown property is ignored! Technically, we can work around that by assigning directly event.clientX=100
after creation. So that’s a matter of convenience and following the rules. Browser-generated events always have the right
type. The full list of properties for different UI events is in the specification, for instance MouseEvent.
