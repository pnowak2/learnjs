The purpose of this attribute is to specify the order number of the element when Tab is used to switch between them. That
is: if we have two elements, the first has tabindex="1", and the second has tabindex="2", then pressing Tab while in the
first element â€“ moves us to the second one. There are two special values: tabindex="0" makes the element the last one. tabindex="-1"
means that Tab should ignore that element.

<br> Click the first item and press Tab. Keep track of the order. Please note that many subsequent Tabs can move the focus
out of the iframe with the example.
<ul>
  <li tabindex="1">One</li>
  <li tabindex="0">Zero</li>
  <!-- last one -->
  <li tabindex="2">Two</li>
  <li tabindex="-1">Minus one</li>
</ul>

<style>
  li {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  
  :focus {
    outline: 1px dashed green;
  }
