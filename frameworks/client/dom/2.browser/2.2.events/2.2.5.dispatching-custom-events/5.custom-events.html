For our own, custom events like "hello" we should use new CustomEvent. Technically CustomEvent is the same as Event, with
one exception. In the second argument (object) we can add an additional property detail for any custom information that we
want to pass with the event.

<h1 id="elem">Hello for John!</h1>

<script>
  // additional details come with the event to the handler
  elem.addEventListener("hello", function (event) {
    alert(event.detail.name);
  });

  const evt = new CustomEvent("hello", {
    detail: { name: "John" }
  });

  elem.dispatchEvent(evt);

</script>
