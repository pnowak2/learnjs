Preventing browser actions

There are two ways to tell the browser we don’t want it to act:

The main way is to use the event object. There’s a method event.preventDefault().
If the handler is assigned using on<event> (not by addEventListener), then we can just return false from it.
In the example below there a click to links don’t lead to URL change:

<br>
<a href="/" onclick="return false">Click here</a>
or
<a href="/" onclick="event.preventDefault()">here</a>
