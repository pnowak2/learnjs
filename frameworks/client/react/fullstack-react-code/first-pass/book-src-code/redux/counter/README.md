### Running the examples

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. We execute the files in the terminal using `babel-node` which comes with `babel-cli`:

````
./node_modules/.bin/babel-node app.js
````
