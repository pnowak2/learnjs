# ALA
Arduino Light Animation (ALA) is a library for Arduino boards to simplify the development of light animations using LEDs and LED strips.

More details, examples and projects can be found [here](http://yaab-arduino.blogspot.com/p/ala.html).

##Features

- Pure Arduino implementation. No external software is needed on the PC to design and drive light animations.
- Support for monochrome LED, RGB LED, multiple LEDs and addressable RGB LED strips using **PWM output pins**, **WS2812 RGB LED strips** and **TLC5940 chips**.
- Lots of cool animations ready to use.
- Precise timing to allow synching animations to music.
- No use of delay() to allow to drive multiple channels and lines independently.
